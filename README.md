# 🔴Min-Max Connect4🔵 #

**Name:** Connect4  
**Version:** 0.1

A graphic based connect 4 game which implements the Min-Max algorithm to determine the computer player's best available move.

I use the pygame Python library to make the graphic interface version of the game and run multiple simulations of games between computers using the Min-Max algorithm to make their moves and gather different statistics from it.

This is how the singleplayer looks for now (might make some changes later)
